# ID Project 1
This project is about creating a porfolio website such as a self-branding website that potential employers can look into for those that considering to hire me. This website will be clear and convenient for employers to find out more about me such as what I have done so far in my life. It includes my education history, achievements, skills, projects and contact information when they decided to hire me. 

Employers are able to identify the content of the pages and easily read the content. Additionally, they are able to go to their desired page section such as about me, competency and skills, projects and contact information. 

# Design Process
I have created a website that is clean and organised. Does not stress readers such as Employers or Employees from Companies who are looking into newly graduated IT students such as myself. The website will provide them minimum information such as education history, schoolworks (in projects), skills (in competency and skills page), achievements I have received and contact informations found from the contact page. If they have decided to hire me after viewing my portfolio website, they are able to straight away write a message to me from the contact page.

For the home page,
there is a picture of me and my name on the left section of the webpage if they are viewing from a monitor screen or laptop screen. Additionally, there are buttons that Employers can click and will be sent to their desired information they would like to start with about knowing me. Moreover, there are other social platform that they can refer to for more information such as LinkedIn and Ngee Ann Polytechnic ICT E-Portfolio (need to use school VPN to access E-Portfolio).

For the main page,
there is a navigation bar on the top right that Employers can click on and go to the section of the page they would like to go. And at the end of the page, there is a convenient contact button Employers can click after reading the information about me.

For the contact page,
there is a navigation bar for Employers to click on if they decided to re-check something or would like to refer back to again. The contact page will show them a contact form they could straight away fill up and send a message to me. Otherwise, there is my contact information for them to such as contact number or email they could note if they decide to hire me.

# Features
I have an index.html which is my home page. It consist of a picture of myself, my name and a brief description of who am I. It has 4 buttons that will direct readers to the main page or the contact page (if they clicked on contact button), depending on which section button they have clicked on. There is also other social platform I have included such as LinkedIn and E-portfolio that readers can refer to. 

In my main.html which is my main page. it consist of contents such as about me, my values, education history, skills, achievements and projects. The main page has a navigation bar that is fixed, so when the reader is scrolling, they are able to refer back to different section of the page at the click of the navigation bar. At the end of the page, I have included a Contact me button which will send users to the contact page. The footer of the page consist of my other social platform readers can click onto.

In my contact.html which is my contact page, readers are able to send me a form by filling up the contact form instead of having to copy my email and send by other social platform. In addition I have included my contact information such as contact number and email address for them to save if they consider hiring me.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
1) Able to automatically email me the message from the contact form.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

# Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears. Does not work
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears. Not included
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears. Not included
only works on desktop screen. On smaller screens such as mobile device. It is messy.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
<button> cannot be a descendent of <a> element.
<html lang="en"> consider adding a <lang> attribute to the <html> start tag to declare the language of the document.
<h> elements are not allowed as child element of <span>
<h1> using for top-level heading only.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
